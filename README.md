## About

Hi, I'm Isabela üëã Over three decades trying new things, excelling in some and failing terribly in others. My latest 'big thing' is the endeavour of becoming a full-stack developer. This website is a testament to my learning journey. It's a work in progress, a living document of my skills and creativity as they develop over time.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: Ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clean aesthetic**: Clean and minimalistic design to highlight content without distractions.
- **Easy navigation**: Simple and intuitive navigation to guide visitors through the site.
- **Dynamic content**: Sections for "About Me," "Work," and "Contact" with links to my social profiles and resume.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content on the web.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website and creating responsive layouts.
